atom-reverser is a packge for [Atom](https://atom.io/) that can reverse your current selection. It reverses for example false to true, height to width, 0 to 1 and many other keywords.

I mainly created this package to see how easy it is to create packages for Atom. Much to my suprise it even got some attention from some people on GitHub and I got some pull requests and other feedback.
