This is a web app that I created for our D&D group. It allows to display information like items and spells to our group. Admins can edit the data that will be displayed. It even features a treasure generator that generates a random treasure with random items and other goodies.

This was the first app where I used a REST-API. I implemented the API using Laravel and consumed it on the client side using vue.js. That frontend was done primarily using the vue-material component library.

I learned a lot doing this project and it was a lot of fun. I still add new things to it as our D&D campain continues.
